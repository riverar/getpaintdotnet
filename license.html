<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions about Licensing</strong></p>
		<p><font size="2"><strong>Can I use Paint.NET for business, commercial, 
		school, or government use? Or is it only free for &quot;personal&quot; use?<br>
		</strong>Yes, you may use it for business, commercial, school, and 
		government use -- the Paint.NET application is free for all of these 
		purposes (and also for personal use). You may install it on as 
		many systems as you&#39;d like, although we do request and appreciate a
		<a href="donate.html">donation</a> to support our ongoing development 
		costs. The main restriction is that you may not modify the Paint.NET 
		software itself (e.g. change the name, add/remove features, &quot;don&#39;t 
		modify the DLL or EXE files&quot;), and as a corollary you may not distribute 
		modified copies of Paint.NET.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><strong>I run a website where I mirror lots of 
		freeware programs; may I also mirror Paint.NET?<br></strong>Yes, so long 
		as you do not charge for access to your website, you may absolutely do 
		this. Redistribution of Paint.NET is permitted so long as it is 
		free-of-charge. For examples of this, see:
		<a href="http://fileforum.betanews.com/">FileForum</a>,
		<a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/">MajorGeeks</a>,
		<a href="http://www.download.com">download.com</a>, and
		<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/">Softpedia</a> (to name a few). 
		However, please note that you may <span class="style1">not</span> 
		redistribute plugins (<a href="redirect/plugins.html">from 
		the forum</a>) unless you have permission from the plugin&#39;s author(s) 
		(this is just to respect standard copyright law, and is not an extra 
		restriction we are imposing on you).</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><strong>May I include Paint.NET on a cover CD/DVD that 
		is included in the magazine I&#39;m publishing?<br></strong>Yes, in general, 
		you may do this so long as you are not charging extra due to the 
		inclusion of Paint.NET.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><strong>Can I use the Paint.NET libraries (DLLs) in my 
		own software or application?<br></strong>No. Paint.NET is only licensed 
		for use as an application, and any use of Paint.NET in other software is 
		strictly prohibited.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><strong>Why does the website refer to Creative 
		Commons? Is Paint.NET licensed under Creative Commons?<br></strong>
		Creative Commons only covers the website contents, and not the Paint.NET 
		software itself which is covered by the license that is printed below.</font></p>
		<p><b><a name="license"></a>License<br>
