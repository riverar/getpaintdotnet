				Paint.NET v4.0</strong><br>
				This release is a long ways away, but development has been 
				going strong. For the latest information on the latest 
				developments, check out <a href="http://blog.getpaint.net">the Paint.NET 
				blog</a>.</font></p>
				<p style="text-align: left"><font size="2">Features planned for 
				version 4.0 include a new UI, improved extensibility, revamped 
				brushes and shapes system, antialiased selections, and adjustment layers. The 
				improvements to the application model and rendering engine 
				should also enable a rich set of features to be added throughout 
				the 4.x lifetime.</font></p>

				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.10 </b>- 
				<a href="download.html">Download</a>, released on October 9th, 
				2011<br>This update fixes some broken shortcut keys for the View -&gt; Actual Size command.</font>
				
				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Fixed: Ctrl+Shift+A now works again as a shortcut for 
					View -&gt; Actual Size (broken in 3.5.9)</li>
					<li>Fixed: Ctrl+0 still works for View -&gt; Actual Size even 
					if 10 or more images are open (broken in 3.5.9, it would 
					switch to the 10th image).</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.9 </b>- 
				released on October 1st, 
				2011<br>This update improves the "Auto-Detect" bit-depth 
				feature, and fixes a few small issues.</font>
				
				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Improved: The "Auto-detect" bit-depth setting for PNG, 
					BMP, and TGA now also determines which bit-depth to use 
					based on which one produces the smallest file size, as well 
					as which ones can save the image without losing fidelity.</li>
					<li>Improved: You can now use Ctrl+0 as a shortcut key for 
					View -&gt; Actual Size, in addition to Ctrl+Shift+A and 
					Ctrl+Alt+0.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Some text in the DirectDraw Surface (DDS) Save 
					Configuration UI was not being loaded.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Some DirectDraw Surface (DDS) files authored with 
					other software (e.g. Unreal 2004) could not be loaded.</li>
					<li>Fixed: In some rare circumstances, clicking on the Save 
					button in the toolbar would crash.</li>
					<li>Fixed: The Korean translation has been added back in, with the 
					help of Bing machine translation to cover the few remaining 
					strings that were untranslated.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.8 </b>- 
				released 
				on March 5th, 2011<br>This update fixes some issues with the 
				fault-tolerant save feature introduced in 3.5.7.</font>
				
				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Fixed: Saving to a folder that has been moved or renamed 
					will display an error instead of crashing (regression from 
					3.5.6)</li>
					<li>Fixed: Saving to a Sharepoint site will now work 
					(regression from 3.5.6)</li>
					<li>Fixed: Saving to a file that is marked as read only will 
					now give an error instead of crashing (regression from 
					3.5.6)</li>
					<li>Fixed: General reliability and correctness improvements 
					to fault-tolerant saving</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.7 </b>- 
				released 
				on February 20th, 2011<br>This update improves reliability of saving, further improves Copy/Paste functionality, and fixes some other miscellaneous bugs.</font>				
				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Saving an image is now fault-tolerant. If there is an 
					error or crash while saving, the original file will be left 
					alone.</li>
					<li>Worked around a bug in some plugins that are incorrectly 
					using the built-in Gaussian Blur effect. For example, 
					Sharpen+. Now they won&#39;t crash.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug with Edit-&gt;Paste into New Image, where the 
					new image would be 1 pixel too wide or tall, as reported at
					<a href="http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/20969-paste-problem/">
					http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/20969-paste-problem/</a> </li>
					<li>Fixed a bug with the Rectangle Select tool and Fixed 
					Ratio selection, which would be off by 1 pixel, as reported 
					at
					<a href="http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/20820-croppig-by-fixed-ratio-is-inexact">
					http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/20820-croppig-by-fixed-ratio-is-inexact</a> </li>
					<li>When pasting an image from Paint.NET into Paint.NET, it 
					will be a little smarter about where it puts the image. 
					Previously, if the location wasn&#39;t within the viewport, it 
					would be placed at the top-left corner of the viewport. Now 
					it will find the nearest point along the edge of the 
					viewport to place the image.</li>
					<li>The EXIF rotation (&quot;orientation&quot;) metadata is now 
					discarded when opening an image, which was causing 
					aggravation with images that could then never be reoriented 
					correctly using Image-&gt;Rotate</li>
					<li>The EXIF metadata for JPEG thumbnail data are now 
					correctly discarded. </li>
					<li>Fixed a handful of memory leaks.</li>
					<li>Fixed a typo in the Italian translation. In the setup 
					wizard it was referring to &quot;Pain.NET&quot; (woops)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.6 -</b> released 
				on November 18th, 2010<br>This update fixes several issues 
				related to copy-paste, improves performance and quality for a 
				few adjustments, and fixes a data loss bug.</font>
				
				<ul><font size="2">
					<li><font size="2">
					When pasting an image, Paint.NET will be smarter 
					about ensuring it is placed within the area that has been 
					scrolled/zoomed to.</font></li>
					<li>Improved the performance and quality of the Curves and 
					Hue/Saturation adjustments.</li>
					<li><font size="2">
					Some minor improvements to memory usage, which 
					should help out a few scenarios on 32-bit systems.</font></li>
					<li>Fixed: If a JPEG was loaded that had an embedded ICC 
					profile, and was then saved as an 8-bit or 24-bit PNG, then 
					the resulting file would be corrupt (32-bit PNG worked fine 
					though).</li>
					<li>Fixed: 16-bit TGAs no longer load with the red and blue 
					channels swapped.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Copy-paste from a Remote Desktop session will no 
					longer be &#39;shifted&#39; by 3 pixels.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Copy-paste from Internet Explorer, Firefox, or 
					Chrome should preserve alpha/transparency.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Copying from Paint.NET and pasting into Windows 
					Live Writer should now work.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Taking a full-screen screenshot with Print Screen 
					on a multimonitor system, where those monitors don&#39;t form a 
					simple rectangle, will now fill the &#39;gap area&#39; with 
					transparent instead of black. (Example: two monitors of the 
					same size, one of which is rotated by 90 degrees)</li>
					<li>Fixed: If Paint.NET is opened without specifying an 
					image to open, and then the default image is modified and 
					saved, then Paint.NET will no longer close it upon 
					opening another one. This was causing data loss if that 
					default image had layers, and was then saved in a format 
					that did not support layers (anything other than .PDN).</li>
					<li>Fixed: Some systems were showing &#39;red X&#39; thumbnails for 
					.PDN files in Windows Explorer, instead of the real 
					thumbnail.</li>
					<li>Fixed: The EXIF &quot;Creation Software&quot; saved along with 
					images is no longer localized. This prevents certain 
					languages from seeing &quot;Paint.NET ????? v3.5.6&quot; in the image 
					properties (metadata).</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.5 </b>- 
				released 
				on April 25th, 2010<br>This update fixes a bug when saving 8-bit images, improves 
				layer composition and Gaussian Blur performance, and is now updated 
				to support the new .NET Framework 4.0 in some cases.</font><ul><font size="2">
					<li><font size="2">
					Fixed the bug where saving as 8-bit PNG/GIF/BMP wasn&#39;t 
					always working, usually with larger images.</font></li>
					<li>Improved the performance of the Gaussian Blur effect by 
					30-40%.</li>
					<li>Improved the performance of all the layer blending modes 
					by 15-30%.</li>
					<li>Improved the performance of zooming with the mouse wheel 
					on dual-core Intel Atom systems.</li>
					<li>Updated to support .NET 4.0 if no other version of .NET 
					is installed. </li>
					<li>Reduced download size from 4.8MB down to 3.5MB.</li>
					<li>Fixed a small error in the Chinese translation.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong><font color="red">Please note that the system requirements have 
				been updated.</font></strong> For Windows XP, you must now have 
				Service Pack 3 (SP3) installed; SP2 is no longer 
				supported. For Windows Vista, you must now have Service 
				Pack 1 installed.</p>
				
                <p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.4 </b>- 
				released on 
				February 25th, 2010<br>This update fixes a few small bugs, and 
				improves performance of the Flatten command.</font>
				
				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Improved performance of the Image-&gt;Flatten command by 
					making it multithreaded.</li>
					<li>Fixed the File-&gt;Save As dialog not opening to the 
					correct folder.</li>
					<li>Fixed a crash with certain plugins and their use of the 
					File Open dialog.</li>
					<li>Fixed a very rare crash with the toolbar&#39;s font list.</li>
				</ul>
				
					</font>
				
				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.3</b>, released on 
				February 7th, 2010<br>This update fixes a few small bugs.</font>
				
				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Fixed DirectDraw Surface (.dds) file format support for 
					CPUs which do not have SSE2 (Pentium III, Athlon XP).</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue with the File-&gt;Save dialog related to 
					file type plugins that were only written for opening 
					(importing).</li>
					<li>Fixed some crashes which were supposed to be &quot;out of 
					memory&quot; errors.</li>
					<li>Fixed a race condition with the New Image, Canvas Size, 
					and Resize dialogs. If you typed extremely fast you could 
					cause a crash by typing a negative number and immediately 
					pressing OK or Enter.</li>
					<li><font size="2">
					Fixed a File-&gt;Save dialog issue in Win7/Vista where it could 
					ask you about overwriting the wrong file.</font></li>
				</ul>
				
					</font>
				
				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.2,</b> released on 
				January 4th, 2010<br>This update resolves some feature 
				disparities in the Text tool between GDI (XP) and DirectWrite 
				(Win7/Vista). It also improves overall performance, as well as 
				the correctness and quality of the Move Selected Pixels tool, 
				the Image-&gt;Resize function, and the Hue/Saturation adjustment.</font>
				
				<ul>
					<li><font size="2">All font face variants (e.g., Arial vs. 
					Arial Narrow) are now available with the Text tool in 
					Win7/Vista with DirectWrite.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Bitmap font types (e.g. Courier, 
						Terminal, Fixedsys) are now available with the Text tool 
						in Win7/Vista.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Fixed some bad text kerning with the 
						Text tool at small font sizes when antialiasing was 
						turned off.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">For the Image-&gt;Resize function, the 
						quality, correctness, and performance of Bilinear 
						and Bicubic sampling modes have been improved. Super 
						Sampling also has some performance improvement.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Improved the rendering quality for 
						the Hue/Saturation adjustment. Also made a new icon for 
						it.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Fixed many subtle rendering issues 
						with the Move Selected Pixels tool. These were apparent 
						when flipping or rotating a selected area.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Fixed: The Line/Curve tool was 
						applying pixel snapping to the curve nodes, which caused 
						lines to &quot;bend&quot; when using the Shift key to constrain 
						the angle.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Fixed some extraneous CPU usage 
						related to unnecessary or redundant thumbnail updates.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Fixed a few dialogs that looked wrong 
						with Aero glass with Remote Desktop or Virtual PC.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Fixed a nasty memory leak with 
						Flatten followed by Undo.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Fixed some issues related to effects 
						that took awhile to cancel. As it turns out, 
						drag-and-drop was enabled at this time, which easily lead to crashes or hangs.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">Some Win7 systems could not detect 
						that .NET 3.5 SP1 was installed, even though it was. A 
						fallback detection function has been added.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">For plugin authors, the Effect class 
						now has a pollable IsCancelRequested property. This can 
						be used to improve responsiveness for expensive 
						OnSetRenderInfo() implementations which are otherwise 
						non-interruptible.</font></li>
						<li><font size="2">For plugin authors, the 
						Surface.FitSurface() method is now optimized to use 
						multiple threads, which improves 
						performance.</font></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.1</b>, released on 
				November 19th, 2009<b><br></b>This update adds a new feature for 
				Windows 7 users, and fixes many small issues that have been 
				found since 3.5&#39;s release.</font></p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><font size="2"><strong>New:</strong> For Windows 7, 
					added taskbar progress reporting for long running operations

					<li><font size="2">Made some corrections to the French 
					translation</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Running setup with /auto will 
					no longer launch Paint.NET when it&#39;s done</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Fixed an issue where Paste into 
					New Image would refuse an image on the clipboard, even 
					if regular Paste would take it</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Fixed a race condition with 
					Edit-&gt;Paste and Image-&gt;Resize whereby it would take up 
					100% CPU and take between 1 minute to 1 hour to finish</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Fixed an issues with Copy/Paste 
					where it would leave an extra line of transparent pixels 
					on the left, top, right, and/or bottom edges</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Fixed lag with the paintbrush 
					tool that was being seen on some systems</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Fixed some issues with the 
					paintbrush and eraser tool being misaligned when zoomed

					<li><font size="2">Fixed a crash that would happen 
					at (seemingly) random times, such as after drawing with 
					the paintbrush tool, on some systems</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Fixed a minor and obscure 
					rendering glitch with the Move Selected Pixels tool</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Fixed an issue with glass over

				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5</b>, released on November 6th, 2009<br>

					<font size="2">
					<li><strong>Improved: </strong>Effect rendering should be a

					</font>
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> Implemented some changes to 
					the &quot;Add Noise&quot; effect that were suggested by a forum 
					member.</li>
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong>
					The canvas background color is now always #c0c0c0.</li>
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> The auto-updater should now 
					correctly detect .NET 3.5 and newer, which will help to save 
					bandwidth when Paint.NET v4.0 is released (it will require 
					.NET 3.5).</li>
					<font size="2">
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Paint.NET now works on a system

					selection tool, the cursor now has a plus or minus 
					indicator.</li>
					</font>
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> The canvas background is now a 
					solid color instead of a gradient. The gradient was causing 
					certain tone misjudgments related to bright versus dark 
					colors.</li>
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> Shortcut key for Sepia is now Ctrl+Shift+E. The 
					shortcut for Posterize is now Ctrl+Shift+P.</li>
					<font size="2">
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> Hotkeys for selection modes 
					are now Left click for Replace, Control+Left click for Add 
					(union), Alt+Left click for Subtract (difference), Ctrl+Left 
					click for Intersect, and Ctrl+Right click for Invert (xor).</li>
					</font>

					<li><font size="2"><strong>Changed</strong>: When using a selection mode 
					other than &quot;replace&quot;, it will now draw the selection outline 
					so that you can see both the original and resulting 
					selection areas. Before, it would only draw the resulting 
					selection area outline, which made modes such as Intersect 
					hard to use.</font></li>
					<font size="2">
					<li><strong>Fixed: </strong>The Resize dialog had some 
					rounding errors with the &quot;Maintain aspect ratio&quot; feature, 
					which caused a few discrepancies and even a spurious &quot;out of 
					memory&quot; error.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Some quirks with the Color Wheel 
					control for IndirectUI-based effect plugins.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Several miscellaneous and rare 
					crashes.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> The installer would display a 
					bizarre error if a &quot;blank&quot; install folder was attempted.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> The installer now only accepts 
					absolute path locations, instead of relative ones. This 
					fixes an ambiguity between where Paint.NET believes it is 
					installing itself to, and the directory that Windows 
					Installer actually uses.</li>
					</font>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Sometimes pasting would result 
					in a crash when certain types of malfored data were on the 
					clipboard.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> It was possible to get around 
					some of the protections imposed by the IndirectUI system. 
					This was causing instability with some effect plugins such 
					as &quot;Fern Fractal&quot;.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> There were some issues with the 
					implementation of &quot;linked&quot; sliders for effects 
					based on IndirectUI.</li>

					Issel, <a href="http://www.BoltBait.com">
					http://www.BoltBait.com</a> .</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>New:</b> DirectDraw Surface (DDS) file 
					format support, by Dean Ashton,
					<a href="http://www.dmashton.co.uk/">
					http://www.dmashton.co.uk/</a> . Improved from the original 
					source code by optimizing the DXT compression library 
					(&quot;Squish&quot;) to take advantage of multiple cores / 
					processors.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>New:</b> &quot;Paint.NET Search&quot;, available 
					from the Help menu (shortcut key is Ctrl+E), allows you to 
					search for Paint.NET help, forum posts, tutorials, plugins, 
					and other related material: <a href="http://searchpaint.net">
					http://searchpaint.net</a> (Note: This feature is only 
					available in English.)</font></li>

					for the Layers window.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Improved:</b> Visual fit-and-finish 
					for the close / &#39;X&#39; button on image thumbnails.</font></li>

					<li><font size="2"><b>Improved:</b> Increased max brush size 
					to 500, as per forum members request.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Improved:</b> Expanded list of 
					available font sizes up through 288.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Changed:</b> The keyboard shortcut key 
					for the Color Picker is now &#39;k&#39;. This makes it so that the 
					toolbar option, &quot;After click: Switch to previous tool&quot;, is 
					not useless for those using the keyboard shortcuts.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> In some cases, undoing an 
					action that removed a layer would result in the un-removed layer not showing up until you resized the Layers window 
					(&quot;ghost layers&quot;).</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Pressing F1 from the main

					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Merge Down now activates 
					the merged layer instead of the one above it.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> In Vista, clicking on a URL 
					link from the installer will no longer launch the web browser with inherited, 
					elevated privileges.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Pressing Ctrl+[ no longer 
					cancels out of drawing a line/curve, but instead decreases 
					the brush size by 5 as expected.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Ctrl+clicking on the brush 
					size +/- buttons now changes the brush size in increments of 
					5.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Save Configuration dialog 
					would &quot;creep downward&quot; from its last position every time it 
					was opened again.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> TGA codec now saves the # 
					of alpha bits to the image descriptor byte. This was causing 
					some other applications to load TGA files saved with 
					Paint.NET as solid black images.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Clicking the &#39;X&#39; to close 
					the Layer Properties dialog was not reverting changes made 
					to the layer while the dialog was open.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Installation will not 
					proceed unless Paint.NET is closed, and will also not allow 
					Paint.NET to be opened until installation is completed. This 
					helps to ensure a fully coherent and complete installation 
					or update.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed: </b>If a file failed to open, 
					and there were no open images, and the user pressed either 
					the Zoom In or Zoom Out toolbar buttons, then Paint.NET 
					would crash.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> In Vista, it was possible 
					to crash the Save As dialog by typing a filename that was 
					too long.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> In Vista, it was possible 
					to crash the updater if you let the UAC prompt time-out.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> It was possible to crash 
					Paint.NET on some systems by clicking on a tool in the Tools

				<b>v3.08 </b>Released<b>: </b>June 1st, 2007<br>
				This is mostly a service release that fixes some bugs, while 
				also improving keyboard / accessibility cues for some dialogs.
				<ul>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Pasting an image from Office 2003 
					applications now works (e.g. Excel 2003 graphs).</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Some dialogs were not indicating which 
					command button was the default. These buttons now have a 
					highlight to indicate which one will be activated if the 
					user presses Enter or Space.</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Some minor keyboard navigation issues with 
					task dialogs</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Performance issue with the File-&gt;Acquire 
					submenu taking a long time to appear</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Window activation issue when the Print 
					wizard was finished / closed</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Crash when there was 1 image open and the 
					user pressed Ctrl+Q and then Ctrl+W</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Minor performance issue if the user had 1 
					modified image open and then canceled the &quot;Save changes?&quot; 
					dialog</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Misbehaving filetype factory 
					implementations (plugins) will no longer cause a crash</li>
				</ul>
				<b>v3.07 </b>Released<b>: </b>May 8th, 2007<br>
				This update enhances the Line/Curve tool, significantly reduces 
				the download size, and fixes some bugs related to opening and 
				saving files in Windows Vista.<ul>
					<li><b>New</b>: Line/Curve tool has been enhanced to allow 
					drawing arrowheads, and to draw with various dashed- and 
					dotted- styles.</li>
					<li><b>New</b>: Image tab thumbnails now have an indicator 
					if the respective image has unsaved changes (an orange 
					asterisk is shown).</li>
					<li><b>Improved:</b> The Save Configuration dialog (choose 
					JPEG quality, etc.) now allows you to maximize it. It also 
					remembers its relative location and size.</li>
					<li><b>Changed:</b> The help file / documentation is now 
					hosted online. This has reduced the download size by more 
					than 3 MB, and will also allow us to provide translations 
					without ballooning the size of the download (each language 
					would have added between 2 and 4MB).</li>
					<li><b>Changed:</b> The &quot;image list button&quot; (downward 
					triangle) is also shown when only 1 image is open (it used 
					to only display if 2 or more images were open). This is 
					being done for the sake of consistency.</li>
					<li><b>Fixed:</b> Some operations would reset the selected 
					layer to the first/lowest layer. This selection is now 
					preserved.</li>
					<li><b>Fixed:</b> The Image-&gt;Rotate commands no longer hang 
					if a selection was active.</li>
					<li><b>Fixed: </b>Several problems have been fixed within 
					our implementation surrounding the new Vista Open/Save 
					dialogs. This includes: opening an image from an http:// 
					source, opening images from a digital camera that is not 
					mapped to a file system path (such as a drive letter), the 
					Save dialog not always prompting you about overwriting an 
					existing file, and many corner cases that previously caused 
					crashes.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>v3.05 </b>Released<b>: </b>March 29th, 2007<br>
				This is a minor update that adds a new effect, improves certain 
				parts of the user interface, and fixes a few minor bugs.<ul>
					<li><b>New</b>: Pencil Sketch effect</li>
					<li><b>New</b>: In Windows Vista, the new-style Save/Open 
					dialogs are used. Among other things, this enables Search 
					functionality.</li>
					<li><b>Changed</b>: The View-&gt;Units, Image-&gt;Flip, 
					Image-&gt;Rotate, and Layers-&gt;Flip submenus have been 
					&quot;flattened&quot; (their commands were moved out into the View, 
					Image, Image, and Layers menus respectively)</li>
					<li><b>Improved</b>: Download size reduced by about 300 KB 
					by using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNGOUT">
					PNGOUT</a></li>
					<li><b>Improved</b>: Some uses of confusing &quot;MessageBox&quot; 
					style dialogs have been changed to a much friendlier &quot;TaskDialog&quot; 
					style interface</li>
					<li><b>Improved</b>: When changing the language, Paint.NET 
					can now restart itself automatically</li>
					<li><b>Improved</b>: Better performance for Move Selected Pixels 
					tool for quad-core systems. This issue is documented and 
					explained here,

					http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2007/03/01/paint-net-many-core-performance-scaling-analyzed.aspx</a> </li>
					<li><b>Removed</b>: The &quot;Clear History&quot; button has been 
					removed because it was not very useful</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Sometimes the Colors window would get 
					&quot;lost&quot; between sessions of Paint.NET</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Stack-overflow crash when using certain 
					effects, such as Gaussian Blur, on very large images with 
					certain settings (such as a 200 pixel radius)</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: When cancelling the multi-image Unsaved 
					Changes dialog, the input focus was sometimes confused</li>
					<li><b>Changed</b>: Renamed PdnLib.dll to 
					PaintDotNet.Core.dll</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Very rare race condition in background 
					thumbnail renderer</li>

				to include them (which could be awhile). </p>
				<p>With this release we have also refreshed Paint.NET&#39;s system 
				requirements. We now list 256 MB as the minimum memory required 
				instead of 128 MB. This is in line with what we have seen to be 
				a more reasonable minimum system for using Paint.NET. Also, 
				Windows XP users must now have SP2 installed (SP1 was required 
				before), Windows 2000 users must have SP4 installed (SP3 was 
				required before), and Windows Server 2003 users must have SP1 
				installed (no SP was required before).</p>
