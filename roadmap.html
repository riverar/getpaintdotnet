				paint.net 4.0.5 - </strong><a href="download.html">Download</a>, released on December 7th, 2014<br>
                This update fixes a few important bugs, some of which were introduced in 4.0.4.</font></p>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Subtraction mode in the Magic Wand tool was generating B-A instead of A-B.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Crash when using Effect-&gt;Repeat.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Crash (AccessViolationException) on some systems when initializing the canvas for hardware accelerated rendering. It will still crash but then switch to software rendering for the next startup, which will then avoid the crashing.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Crash when clicking on the Shapes tool if you had run an old 4.0 beta/alpha and had also changed which shape is used at startup to be a line or curve.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Crash when using Settings -&gt; Update -&gt; Check Now due to incorrectly determining that UAC is not enabled.</li>
				</font></ul>

				<font size="2"><strong><br>
				paint.net 4.0.4 - </strong>released on November 29th, 2014<br>
				This update greatly improves performance in some key areas, fixes some important bugs, and reintroduces a feature that was omitted in the transition from 3.5 to 4.0.</font></p>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li><strong>New</strong>: Added a 'Fill' property to the Paintbrush tool (regression from 3.5).</li>
					<li><strong>Faster</strong>: Move Selected Pixels has been significantly optimized.</li>
					<li><strong>Faster</strong>: Magic Wand Tool has been significantly optimized.</li>
					<li><strong>Faster</strong>: Working with aliased selections ("aliased selection quality" in the toolbar) has been significantly optimized.</li>
					<li><strong>Faster</strong>: Edit-&gt;Copy and Edit-&gt;Copy Merged are now up to 2x faster.</li>
					<li><strong>Faster</strong>: Drawing when a selection is active; clipping performance is now improved.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: The Text tool no longer produces terrible looking text when using Smooth rendering mode without antialiasing.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: The Gear shape had a few glitches.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Using a Fill pattern with the Paint Bucket would sometimes produces misaligned or "corrupt looking" results.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: The alignment of the menu buttons in the top-right was off by 2 pixels, causing them to look weird at high-DPI.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: The zoom buttons in the status
					bar would not recognize clicks unless the main window was
					already in focus.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Some incorrect errors about requiring Windows 7 SP1 when launching the installer from something like an old version of WinZip.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Edit-&gt;Clear Selection and
					Edit-&gt;Cut were filling with transparent black (#00000000)
					instead of transparent white (#00FFFFFF). This caused some
					discrepancies compared to older versions of Paint.NET
					(regression from 3.5).</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Pressing Ctrl+A when a drawing tool was active would sometimes incorrectly show a tinted selection.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Text in the title bar was not visible when using a 3rd party Aero theme with black titlebars.</li>
				</font></ul>


				<font size="2"><strong><br>
				paint.net 4.0.3 - </strong>released on July 22nd, 2014<br>
				This update fixes a few small bugs and improves performance.</font></p>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Further improved performance when working with images that have a lot of layers.</li>
					<li>Fixed some flickering in the Layers form.</li>
					<li>Fixed the Language selector in the Settings dialog.</li>
					<li>Fixed 2-finger touchpad and touch screen scrolling.</li>
					<li>Aero peek thumbnails now include the pixel grid if it's enabled.</li>
					<li>Fixed a crash in the thumbnail renderer that sometimes happened when switching between images.</li>
					<li>Ctrl+W no longer exits the application if zero images are open.</li>
				</font></ul>

				<font size="2"><strong><br>
				paint.net 4.0.2 - </strong> released on July 15th, 2014<br>
				This update fixes a few small bugs and feature regressions from 3.5.</font></p>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Fixed the gamma and contrast for text rendering on some systems where the wrong values were being used ("rainbow" text)</li>
					<li>Colors window now correctly lets you paste a hex color value that starts with a hash, e.g. #112233</li>
					<li>Gradient tool now lets you reverse a transparency gradient by clicking the right mouse button on one of the handles (regression from 3.5)</li>
					<li>Move Selected Pixels now lets you hold Control to leave a copy of the selected area behind on the initial move (regression from 3.5)</li>
					<li>Paint Bucket tool's hatch fill modes weren't working with the Overwrite blending mode (regression from 3.5)</li>
					<li>Fixed a keyboard tabbing issue in the Resize dialog (regression from 3.5)</li>

					<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the 4.0.1 from installing on top of 4.0 when using the MSI (e.g. AD/GPO network deployment)</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause the installer to take 30+ seconds to appear</li>
				</font></ul>

				<font size="2"><strong><br>
				paint.net 4.0.1</strong> - released on July 12th, 2014<br>
				This update is focused on fixing some important crashes, bricks,
				and functionality issues, and also on a few key performance
				optimizations.</font></p>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Move Selected Pixels tool performance has been
					significantly optimized.</li>
					<li>Move Selected Pixels tool was always leaving transparent
					black behind instead of the secondary color with alpha
					removed.</li>
					<li>Brush tools with odd-sized brushes and no antialiasing
					were drawing at 1 size smaller.</li>
					<li>Fixed some apparent ‘lag’ in the brush tools due to an
					off-by-1 glitch in the stroke path calculation code.</li>
					<li>The brush tool preview circle no longer scales by the
					system DPI setting, which made it too big.</li>
					<li>Removed the momentary hourglass/wait cursor after
					drawing (e.g. pencil and brush tools).</li>
					<li>Optimized performance of the Shapes tool, especially for
					the Ellipse shape.</li>
					<li>Paint Bucket tool will now correctly treat the selection
					as a boundary contour.</li>
					<li>Zoom tool no longer crashes sometimes when pressing the
					right mouse button while already holding the left mouse
					button.</li>
					<li>The status bar now reports the correct selection
					location when it’s outside the image boundaries (e.g.
					negative values).</li>
					<li>Auto-scrolling on the edge of the window now works
					correctly and doesn’t require you to "jiggle the mouse" for
					each scroll update.</li>
					<li>Touch screens no longer scroll when swiping up/down with
					one finger.</li>
					<li>Improved the pixel grid’s contrast so it’s not
					overwhelmingly bright.</li>
					<li>The transparency "checkerboard" is now aligned to the
					top-left of the image, instead of the top-left of the
					canvas.</li>
					<li>The cursor position reported in the status bar was
					off-by-1 when the value was supposed to be negative.</li>
					<li>Some controls (e.g. units selection in the Image-&gt;Resize
					dialog) were not drawing focus rectangles when using the
					keyboard.</li>
					<li>Fixed a crash (OutOfMemoryException) when using a
					selection tool when hardware acceleration is disabled.</li>
					<li>Fixed a crash (TimeBeforeLastUpdateException) in the
					installer. This usually happens when running in a virtual
					machine, and only affects animations.</li>
					<li>Fixed a crash (BadImageFormatException) at startup. This
					indicates an installation error, and will be automatically
					repaired.</li>
					<li>Fixed various crashes caused by having the wrong (old)
					version of PaintDotNet.SystemLayer.Native.dll. This
					indicates an installation error, and will be automatically
					repaired.</li>
					<li>Improved performance when software rendering is used
					(e.g. when hardware accelerated rendering is disabled).</li>
					<li>All 7th generation Intel GPUs now default to hardware
					rendering. All older Intel GPUs default to software
					rendering.</li>
					<li>Fixed graphical artifacts (blackness, flickering, mouse
					trails) on certain GPUs (e.g. NVIDIA Optimus).</li>
					<li>NVIDIA ION graphics cards now default to software
					rendering due to crashes.</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue that was causing beta updates to be
					offered even if “Also check for pre-release (beta) versions
					of paint.net” was disabled in Settings</li>
				</font>
				</ul>

				<p style="text-align: left"><font size="2"><strong>paint.net 4.0 - </strong>released on
				June 24th, 2014<br>
				This release improves performance and memory usage with a new
				rendering engine optimized for multicore CPUs and hardware
				acceleration (GPU). Most tools now support "fine grained
				history" and live adjustment of their properties, including the
				Magic Wand and Paint Bucket. Selections are now antialiased,
				which greatly improves their quality. </font></p>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li><strong>System Requirements</li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Windows 7 SP1 or newer is now required.</li>
						<li>.NET Framework 4.5 is now required, and will be installed if needed.</li>
						<li>A dual-core (or more!) processor is highly recommended.</li>
						<li>Hardware acceleration (GPU) via Direct2D is now supported.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Please disable this in the Settings dialog if you experience visual artifacts.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Performance</li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>A brand new, asynchronous, fully multithreaded rendering engine allows performance to scale very well with respect to the number of CPU cores whether you have 2, 4, 6, or even 16 of them.</li>
						<li>The responsiveness of the user interface has been greatly improved, especially when working with large images.</li>
						<li>Memory usage is lower.</li>
						<li>Improved battery life impact due to fixing the way the floating windows manage their transparency.</li>
						<li>Startup performance when many plugins are installed is improved, thanks to the
						<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2012/10/18/an-easy-solution-for-improving-app-launch-performance.aspx">Multicore JIT feature introduced in .NET 4.5</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Selections</li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Selections are now antialiased, which greatly improves the quality around the edges of selected content. You can turn this on and off at any time from the toolbar.</li>
						<li>Everything related to selections now has much higher performance and greatly reduced CPU usage, especially if hardware acceleration (GPU) is enabled.</li>
						<li>The selection outline is now rendered using the "dancing ants" animation, which greatly improves the contrast between it and the image itself.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>General</li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The functionality previously provided by the Utilities, Window, and Help menus has been simplified, consolidated, and moved to the top-right corner of the main window.<br>
							<img src="images/pdn4_topright.png" /></li>
						<li>The image thumbnail list has been moved up 1 row so that it no longer intrudes into the current Tool's toolbar space. This means it will no longer "jump around" when you switch between tools. This also means that it is aligned to the top of the monitor when the main window is maximized, making it easier to click on images
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law">(Fitt's law)</a>.</li>
						<li>The image thumbnail list can now be reordered with drag-and-drop.</li>
						<li>A brand new Settings dialog makes it much easier to configure all the tool and toolbar defaults, among other things.</li>
						<li>The zoom slider and units selector have been moved from the toolbar to the bottom right corner of the window (into the status bar).</li>
						<li>Each image now shows up as its own taskbar item. This can be disabled in the Settings dialog with "Show image previews in the Windows taskbar."</li>
						<li>Layers can now be reordered with drag-and-drop.</li>
						<li>Ctrl+Click on the Move Layer Up/Down buttons will now move a layer to the top/bottom, respectively.</li>
						<li>Improved quality of Image -&gt; Resize.</li>
						<li>Edit -&gt; Copy Merged will copy all layers to the clipboard without having to use Image
						-&gt; Flatten first.</li>
						<li>Copying to the clipboard now includes the "PNG" format, which allows transparency to survive from many popular applications (e.g. Office)</li>
						<li>You can now use the middle mouse button to scroll/pan the image at any time (same functionality as holding down the spacebar along with clicking and dragging the mouse).</li>
						<li>Shift+Backspace will now fill the selection with the
						secondary color (Backspace, the shortcut key for Edit -&gt; Fill Selection, still fills with primary color as usual).</li>
						<li>paint.net now shows up in Windows' “Default Programs” control panel so you can configure its file type associations without reinstalling.</li>
						<li>EXIF rotation metadata is now applied when opening images (e.g. JPG taken with a rotated camera).</li>
						<li>Eleven (11) <strong>new languages</strong>, bringing the total to 21: Chinese (Simplified),
						<strong>Chinese (Traditional)</strong>, <strong>Czech</strong>,
						<strong>Danish</strong>, <strong>Dutch</strong>, English,
						<strong>Finnish</strong>, French, German, <strong>Hindi</strong>,
						<strong>Hungarian</strong>, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
						<strong>Lithuanian</strong>, <strong>Persian</strong>,
						<strong>Polish</strong>, Portuguese (Brazilian), <strong>Portuguese (Portugal)</strong>, Russian, and Spanish.</li>
						<li>Crash logs are now stored in <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\paint.net\CrashLogs</strong> (e.g. C:\Users\<em>username</em>\AppData\Local\paint.net\CrashLogs) instead of on the desktop.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Effects</li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>New effect: Photo -&gt; Vignette.</li>
						<li>Improved the quality of the Photo -&gt; Red Eye Removal effect.</li>
						<li>Improved UI for Layers -&gt; Rotate/Zoom.</li>
						<li>Effect plugins now show up with a jigsaw puzzle icon next to them in the menus. You can hover over the effect to see information about it, including the author and location of its DLL.</li>
						<li>Errors while loading effect plugins are now displayed in the Settings dialog.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Tools</li></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Most Tools now support "fine-grained history." You may adjust the properties of what you've drawn (e.g. colors, toolbar settings) before committing to the layer (use the "Finish" button or press Enter), and each change is tracked in the history.</li>
						<li>Tools may now draw directly with a blending mode, configurable from the toolbar. All of the layer blending modes are supported, as well as “Overwrite.”<br><img src="images/pdn4_toolblending.png" /></li>
						<li>Drawing tools (Pencil, Paintbrush, Eraser, Clone Stamp, Recolor) now have much smoother mouse input handling via
						<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646259(v=vs.85).aspx">GetMouseMovePointsEx</a>.</li>
						<li>Brush tools (Paintbrush, Eraser, Clone Stamp, Recolor) now have soft brushes support via a “Hardness” setting in the toolbar.</li>
						<li>The Move tools (Move Selected Pixels, Move Selection) have a much better UI for scaling, moving, and (especially) rotation.</li>
						<li>The Move tools now support moving the rotation anchor, which changes the center of rotation.</li>
						<li>The new Shapes tool replaces the Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, and Freeform shape tools. 27 shapes are currently available. You may move, resize, and rotate a shape, as well as reconfigure any other properties from the toolbar (color, outline size, etc.) before committing it to the layer.</li>
						<li>Color Picker has a configurable sampling radius, and can sample from either the current layer or the whole image.</li>
						<li>Gradient tool now supports a new Spiral gradient type and allows configuration of the repeat mode (none, repeat, wrapped).</li>
						<li>Gradient tool has improved rendering quality via dithering and antialiasing. You can control both of these with the standard antialiasing toggle in the toolbar.</li>
						<li>Magic Wand and Paint Bucket now allow live adjustment of Tolerance and the Origin (click location) after clicking (press Enter to commit/finish).</li>
						<li>Magic Wand and Paint Bucket can now sample from either the current layer or the whole image.</li>
						<li>Paint Bucket tool now supports anti-aliasing.</li>
						<li>Recolor tool can now use the color of the pixel where you click as the color to be replaced. Or, as usual, it can use the secondary color.</li>
						<li>Text tool now supports multiple rendering modes: Smooth, Sharp (Modern), and Sharp (Classic). These correspond to DirectWrite rendering modes of Outline, ClearType Natural Symmetric, and GDI Classic, respectively.</li>
						<li>Text tool now supports colored fonts on Windows 8.1.</li>

				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.11</b> -
				released on August 17th,
				2013<br>The primary goal of this update is preparing for the v4.0 release: previous versions of Paint.NET will <em>not</em> be able to offer the v4.0 update.
				Also included are some small fixes and performance improvements that have been ported over from the v4.0 codebase.</font>

				<ul><font size="2">
				    <li>Fixed: The Gaussian Blur effect was incorrectly calculating alpha values for non-opaque pixels.</li>
				    <li>Improved performance of the Sharpen effect by about 25%</li>
				    <li>Improved performance of the Median effect by about 30%</li>
				    <li>Improved performance of the Fragment effect by about 40%</li>
				    <li>Improved performance of the Unfocus effect by about 100%</li>
				    <li>Reduced memory usage when many selection manipulation operations are in the history/undo stack (the undo data is now saved to disk)</li>
				    <li>The built-in updater now supports upgrading to paint.net 4.0 (when it's available)</li>
				</ul>

				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.10 </b>-
				released on October 9th,
				2011<br>This update fixes some broken shortcut keys for the View -&gt; Actual Size command.</font>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Fixed: Ctrl+Shift+A now works again as a shortcut for
					View -&gt; Actual Size (broken in 3.5.9)</li>
					<li>Fixed: Ctrl+0 still works for View -&gt; Actual Size even
					if 10 or more images are open (broken in 3.5.9, it would
					switch to the 10th image).</li>
				</ul>


				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.9 </b>-
				released on October 1st,
				2011<br>This update improves the "Auto-Detect" bit-depth
				feature, and fixes a few small issues.</font>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Improved: The "Auto-detect" bit-depth setting for PNG,
					BMP, and TGA now also determines which bit-depth to use
					based on which one produces the smallest file size, as well
					as which ones can save the image without losing fidelity.</li>
					<li>Improved: You can now use Ctrl+0 as a shortcut key for
					View -&gt; Actual Size, in addition to Ctrl+Shift+A and
					Ctrl+Alt+0.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Some text in the DirectDraw Surface (DDS) Save
					Configuration UI was not being loaded.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Some DirectDraw Surface (DDS) files authored with
					other software (e.g. Unreal 2004) could not be loaded.</li>
					<li>Fixed: In some rare circumstances, clicking on the Save
					button in the toolbar would crash.</li>
					<li>Fixed: The Korean translation has been added back in, with the
					help of Bing machine translation to cover the few remaining
					strings that were untranslated.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.8 </b>-
				released
				on March 5th, 2011<br>This update fixes some issues with the
				fault-tolerant save feature introduced in 3.5.7.</font>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Fixed: Saving to a folder that has been moved or renamed
					will display an error instead of crashing (regression from
					3.5.6)</li>
					<li>Fixed: Saving to a Sharepoint site will now work
					(regression from 3.5.6)</li>
					<li>Fixed: Saving to a file that is marked as read only will
					now give an error instead of crashing (regression from
					3.5.6)</li>
					<li>Fixed: General reliability and correctness improvements
					to fault-tolerant saving</li>
				</ul>

				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.7 </b>-
				released
				on February 20th, 2011<br>This update improves reliability of saving, further improves Copy/Paste functionality, and fixes some other miscellaneous bugs.</font>
				<ul><font size="2">
					<li>Saving an image is now fault-tolerant. If there is an
					error or crash while saving, the original file will be left
					alone.</li>
					<li>Worked around a bug in some plugins that are incorrectly
					using the built-in Gaussian Blur effect. For example,
					Sharpen+. Now they won&#39;t crash.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug with Edit-&gt;Paste into New Image, where the
					new image would be 1 pixel too wide or tall, as reported at
					<a href="http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/20969-paste-problem/">
					http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/20969-paste-problem/</a> </li>
					<li>Fixed a bug with the Rectangle Select tool and Fixed
					Ratio selection, which would be off by 1 pixel, as reported
					at
					<a href="http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/20820-croppig-by-fixed-ratio-is-inexact">
					http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/20820-croppig-by-fixed-ratio-is-inexact</a> </li>
					<li>When pasting an image from Paint.NET into Paint.NET, it
					will be a little smarter about where it puts the image.
					Previously, if the location wasn&#39;t within the viewport, it
					would be placed at the top-left corner of the viewport. Now
					it will find the nearest point along the edge of the
					viewport to place the image.</li>
					<li>The EXIF rotation (&quot;orientation&quot;) metadata is now
					discarded when opening an image, which was causing
					aggravation with images that could then never be reoriented
					correctly using Image-&gt;Rotate</li>
					<li>The EXIF metadata for JPEG thumbnail data are now
					correctly discarded. </li>
					<li>Fixed a handful of memory leaks.</li>
					<li>Fixed a typo in the Italian translation. In the setup
					wizard it was referring to &quot;Pain.NET&quot; (woops)</li>
				</ul>

				<p><font size="2"><b>Paint.NET v3.5.6 -</b> released
				on November 18th, 2010<br>This update fixes several issues
				related to copy-paste, improves performance and quality for a
				few adjustments, and fixes a data loss bug.</font>

				<ul><font size="2">
					<li><font size="2">
					When pasting an image, Paint.NET will be smarter
					about ensuring it is placed within the area that has been
					scrolled/zoomed to.</font></li>
					<li>Improved the performance and quality of the Curves and
					Hue/Saturation adjustments.</li>
					<li><font size="2">
					Some minor improvements to memory usage, which
					should help out a few scenarios on 32-bit systems.</font></li>
					<li>Fixed: If a JPEG was loaded that had an embedded ICC
					profile, and was then saved as an 8-bit or 24-bit PNG, then
					the resulting file would be corrupt (32-bit PNG worked fine
					though).</li>
					<li>Fixed: 16-bit TGAs no longer load with the red and blue
					channels swapped.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Copy-paste from a Remote Desktop session will no
					longer be &#39;shifted&#39; by 3 pixels.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Copy-paste from Internet Explorer, Firefox, or
					Chrome should preserve alpha/transparency.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Copying from Paint.NET and pasting into Windows
					Live Writer should now work.</li>
					<li>Fixed: Taking a full-screen screenshot with Print Screen
					on a multimonitor system, where those monitors don&#39;t form a
					simple rectangle, will now fill the &#39;gap area&#39; with
					transparent instead of black. (Example: two monitors of the
					same size, one of which is rotated by 90 degrees)</li>
					<li>Fixed: If Paint.NET is opened without specifying an
					image to open, and then the default image is modified and
					saved, then Paint.NET will no longer close it upon
					opening another one. This was causing data loss if that
					default image had layers, and was then saved in a format
					that did not support layers (anything other than .PDN).</li>
					<li>Fixed: Some systems were showing &#39;red X&#39; thumbnails for
					.PDN files in Windows Explorer, instead of the real
					thumbnail.</li>
					<li>Fixed: The EXIF &quot;Creation Software&quot; saved along with
					images is no longer localized. This prevents certain
					languages from seeing &quot;Paint.NET ????? v3.5.6&quot; in the image
					properties (metadata).</li>

					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> Implemented some changes to

					<li><strong>Changed:</strong>
					The canvas background color is now always #c0c0c0.</li>
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> The auto-updater should now
					correctly detect .NET 3.5 and newer, which will help to save
					bandwidth when Paint.NET v4.0 is released (it will require
					.NET 3.5).</li>
					<font size="2">
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Paint.NET now works on a system
					that has the .NET 3.5 SP1 &quot;Client Profile&quot; installed.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> When zoomed in and the
					cursor is to the top-left of the image (negative
					coordinates), the ruler is now highlighted in the correct
					area.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> The effect rendering system no
					longer sets the &quot;Tag&quot; property on the configuration dialog.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Some incorrectly authored
					plugins would cause a crash when loading their support
					details (author, copyright, etc.).</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> There was a bug in the color
					wheel for IndirectUI that caused it to show the wrong values
					at initialization.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> There was a performance problem
					for effects that used the IndirectUI color wheel control.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> In some rare cases, Paint.NET

				July 7th, 2008<br>
				This releases introduces a new Posterize adjustment, a new

					<font size="2">
					<li><strong>New:</strong>
					Posterize adjustment, by Ed Harvey.</li>
					<li><strong>New:</strong> Intersect selection editing mode.</li>
					<li><font size="2">
					<strong>Improved:</strong> Dramatically improved
					selection editing performance for the Add and Subtract modes
					(and also for Intersect). The performance used to be
					dependent on image size, and thus was often unusable on
					images larger than 1024x768 pixels. It is now dependent only
					on selection complexity (number of polygon edges) -- the
					improvement is generally between 3x and 1000x.</font></li>
					<li><strong>New:</strong> When holding Ctrl or Alt for a
					selection tool, the cursor now has a plus or minus
					indicator.</li>
					</font>
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> The canvas background is now a
					solid color instead of a gradient. The gradient was causing
					certain tone misjudgments related to bright versus dark
					colors.</li>
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> Shortcut key for Sepia is now Ctrl+Shift+E. The
					shortcut for Posterize is now Ctrl+Shift+P.</li>
					<font size="2">
					<li><strong>Changed:</strong> Hotkeys for selection modes
					are now Left click for Replace, Control+Left click for Add
					(union), Alt+Left click for Subtract (difference), Ctrl+Left
					click for Intersect, and Ctrl+Right click for Invert (xor).</li>
					</font>

					<li><font size="2"><strong>Changed</strong>: When using a selection mode
					other than &quot;replace&quot;, it will now draw the selection outline
					so that you can see both the original and resulting
					selection areas. Before, it would only draw the resulting
					selection area outline, which made modes such as Intersect
					hard to use.</font></li>
					<font size="2">
					<li><strong>Fixed: </strong>The Resize dialog had some
					rounding errors with the &quot;Maintain aspect ratio&quot; feature,
					which caused a few discrepancies and even a spurious &quot;out of
					memory&quot; error.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Some quirks with the Color Wheel
					control for IndirectUI-based effect plugins.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Several miscellaneous and rare
					crashes.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> The installer would display a
					bizarre error if a &quot;blank&quot; install folder was attempted.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> The installer now only accepts
					absolute path locations, instead of relative ones. This
					fixes an ambiguity between where Paint.NET believes it is
					installing itself to, and the directory that Windows
					Installer actually uses.</li>
					</font>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Sometimes pasting would result
					in a crash when certain types of malfored data were on the
					clipboard.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> It was possible to get around
					some of the protections imposed by the IndirectUI system.
					This was causing instability with some effect plugins such
					as &quot;Fern Fractal&quot;.</li>
					<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> There were some issues with the
					implementation of &quot;linked&quot; sliders for effects
					based on IndirectUI.</li>

                </a><b>Paint.NET v3.10 </b>Released<b>: </b>August 23rd, 2007<br>
				This release adds two new
				effects originally written by David Issel ("BoltBait"), support for the	DDS filetype originally
				written by Dean Ashton, as well as many small bug fixes and some visual fit and finish.
				<ul>
					<li><font size="2"><b>New:</b> Soften Portrait effect, by
					David Issel, <a href="http://www.BoltBait.com">
					http://www.BoltBait.com</a> .</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>New:</b> Ink Sketch effect, by David
					Issel, <a href="http://www.BoltBait.com">
					http://www.BoltBait.com</a> .</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>New:</b> DirectDraw Surface (DDS) file
					format support, by Dean Ashton,
					<a href="http://www.dmashton.co.uk/">
					http://www.dmashton.co.uk/</a> . Improved from the original
					source code by optimizing the DXT compression library
					(&quot;Squish&quot;) to take advantage of multiple cores /
					processors.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>New:</b> &quot;Paint.NET Search&quot;, available
					from the Help menu (shortcut key is Ctrl+E), allows you to
					search for Paint.NET help, forum posts, tutorials, plugins,
					and other related material: <a href="http://searchpaint.net">
					http://searchpaint.net</a> (Note: This feature is only
					available in English.)</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Improved:</b> Visual fit-and-finish
					for the Layers window.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Improved:</b> Visual fit-and-finish
					for the close / &#39;X&#39; button on image thumbnails.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Improved:</b> Small (about 5-10%)
					performance improvements for some effects such as Oil
					Painting, Frosted Glass, and Gaussian Blur.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Improved:</b> Increased max brush size
					to 500, as per forum members request.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Improved:</b> Expanded list of
					available font sizes up through 288.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Changed:</b> The keyboard shortcut key
					for the Color Picker is now &#39;k&#39;. This makes it so that the
					toolbar option, &quot;After click: Switch to previous tool&quot;, is
					not useless for those using the keyboard shortcuts.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> In some cases, undoing an
					action that removed a layer would result in the un-removed layer not showing up until you resized the Layers window
					(&quot;ghost layers&quot;).</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Pressing F1 from the main
					window no longer launches the online help in two browser tabs.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Adding a new layer now adds
					it above the currently active layer, instead of at the very
					top of the layer list.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Merge Down now activates
					the merged layer instead of the one above it.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> In Vista, clicking on a URL
					link from the installer will no longer launch the web browser with inherited,
					elevated privileges.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Pressing Ctrl+[ no longer
					cancels out of drawing a line/curve, but instead decreases
					the brush size by 5 as expected.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Ctrl+clicking on the brush
					size +/- buttons now changes the brush size in increments of
					5.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Save Configuration dialog
					would &quot;creep downward&quot; from its last position every time it
					was opened again.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> TGA codec now saves the #
					of alpha bits to the image descriptor byte. This was causing
					some other applications to load TGA files saved with
					Paint.NET as solid black images.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Clicking the &#39;X&#39; to close
					the Layer Properties dialog was not reverting changes made
					to the layer while the dialog was open.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> Installation will not
					proceed unless Paint.NET is closed, and will also not allow
					Paint.NET to be opened until installation is completed. This
					helps to ensure a fully coherent and complete installation
					or update.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed: </b>If a file failed to open,
					and there were no open images, and the user pressed either
					the Zoom In or Zoom Out toolbar buttons, then Paint.NET
					would crash.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> In Vista, it was possible
					to crash the Save As dialog by typing a filename that was
					too long.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> In Vista, it was possible
					to crash the updater if you let the UAC prompt time-out.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2"><b>Fixed:</b> It was possible to crash
					Paint.NET on some systems by clicking on a tool in the Tools
					window while the &quot;Save As&quot; dialog was open.</li>
					</ul>

				<b>v3.08 </b>Released<b>: </b>June 1st, 2007<br>
				This is mostly a service release that fixes some bugs, while
				also improving keyboard / accessibility cues for some dialogs.
				<ul>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Pasting an image from Office 2003
					applications now works (e.g. Excel 2003 graphs).</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Some dialogs were not indicating which
					command button was the default. These buttons now have a
					highlight to indicate which one will be activated if the
					user presses Enter or Space.</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Some minor keyboard navigation issues with
					task dialogs</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Performance issue with the File-&gt;Acquire
					submenu taking a long time to appear</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Window activation issue when the Print
					wizard was finished / closed</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Crash when there was 1 image open and the
					user pressed Ctrl+Q and then Ctrl+W</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Minor performance issue if the user had 1
					modified image open and then canceled the &quot;Save changes?&quot;
					dialog</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Misbehaving filetype factory
					implementations (plugins) will no longer cause a crash</li>
				</ul>
				<b>v3.07 </b>Released<b>: </b>May 8th, 2007<br>
				This update enhances the Line/Curve tool, significantly reduces
				the download size, and fixes some bugs related to opening and
				saving files in Windows Vista.<ul>
					<li><b>New</b>: Line/Curve tool has been enhanced to allow
					drawing arrowheads, and to draw with various dashed- and
					dotted- styles.</li>
					<li><b>New</b>: Image tab thumbnails now have an indicator
					if the respective image has unsaved changes (an orange
					asterisk is shown).</li>
					<li><b>Improved:</b> The Save Configuration dialog (choose
					JPEG quality, etc.) now allows you to maximize it. It also
					remembers its relative location and size.</li>
					<li><b>Changed:</b> The help file / documentation is now
					hosted online. This has reduced the download size by more
					than 3 MB, and will also allow us to provide translations
					without ballooning the size of the download (each language
					would have added between 2 and 4MB).</li>
					<li><b>Changed:</b> The &quot;image list button&quot; (downward
					triangle) is also shown when only 1 image is open (it used
					to only display if 2 or more images were open). This is
					being done for the sake of consistency.</li>
					<li><b>Fixed:</b> Some operations would reset the selected
					layer to the first/lowest layer. This selection is now
					preserved.</li>
					<li><b>Fixed:</b> The Image-&gt;Rotate commands no longer hang
					if a selection was active.</li>
					<li><b>Fixed: </b>Several problems have been fixed within
					our implementation surrounding the new Vista Open/Save
					dialogs. This includes: opening an image from an http://
					source, opening images from a digital camera that is not
					mapped to a file system path (such as a drive letter), the
					Save dialog not always prompting you about overwriting an
					existing file, and many corner cases that previously caused
					crashes.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>v3.05 </b>Released<b>: </b>March 29th, 2007<br>
				This is a minor update that adds a new effect, improves certain
				parts of the user interface, and fixes a few minor bugs.<ul>
					<li><b>New</b>: Pencil Sketch effect</li>
					<li><b>New</b>: In Windows Vista, the new-style Save/Open
					dialogs are used. Among other things, this enables Search
					functionality.</li>
					<li><b>Changed</b>: The View-&gt;Units, Image-&gt;Flip,
					Image-&gt;Rotate, and Layers-&gt;Flip submenus have been
					&quot;flattened&quot; (their commands were moved out into the View,
					Image, Image, and Layers menus respectively)</li>
					<li><b>Improved</b>: Download size reduced by about 300 KB
					by using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNGOUT">
					PNGOUT</a></li>
					<li><b>Improved</b>: Some uses of confusing &quot;MessageBox&quot;
					style dialogs have been changed to a much friendlier &quot;TaskDialog&quot;
					style interface</li>
					<li><b>Improved</b>: When changing the language, Paint.NET
					can now restart itself automatically</li>
					<li><b>Improved</b>: Better performance for Move Selected Pixels
					tool for quad-core systems. This issue is documented and
					explained here,

					http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2007/03/01/paint-net-many-core-performance-scaling-analyzed.aspx</a> </li>
					<li><b>Removed</b>: The &quot;Clear History&quot; button has been
					removed because it was not very useful</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Sometimes the Colors window would get
					&quot;lost&quot; between sessions of Paint.NET</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Stack-overflow crash when using certain
					effects, such as Gaussian Blur, on very large images with
					certain settings (such as a 200 pixel radius)</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: When cancelling the multi-image Unsaved
					Changes dialog, the input focus was sometimes confused</li>
					<li><b>Changed</b>: Renamed PdnLib.dll to
					PaintDotNet.Core.dll</li>
					<li><b>Fixed</b>: Very rare race condition in background
					thumbnail renderer</li>

				</b>Released:<b> </b> August 2nd, 2006<br>
				This is a small interim release that includes many of the

				<p>With this release we have also refreshed Paint.NET&#39;s system
				requirements. We now list 256 MB as the minimum memory required
				instead of 128 MB. This is in line with what we have seen to be
				a more reasonable minimum system for using Paint.NET. Also,
				Windows XP users must now have SP2 installed (SP1 was required
				before), Windows 2000 users must have SP4 installed (SP3 was
				required before), and Windows Server 2003 users must have SP1
				installed (no SP was required before).</p>

				<strong><font size="2"><a name="v1_1"></a>Paint.NET v1.1<br>
				</font></strong>
				<font size="2">Released: October 1st, 2004<br>
				This release included many user interface tweaks and bug fixes.</font><ul>
					<li><font size="2">New Effect: &quot;RotoZoomer&quot; which can
					perform arbitrary angle rotation, and zooming.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">More responsive Effect preview rendering.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Faster application startup time.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">&quot;Open Recent&quot; menu keeps track of the
					last 8 images you worked with, along with a thumbnail for
					each.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Selecting an area now draws an outline
					along with the blue highlight.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Layer Properties now visually previews
					and updates all properties in real time without having to
					press the &quot;Apply&quot; button.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Invert and Desaturate are put into the
					Layers -&gt; Adjustments menu, along with a new adjustment
					called &quot;Brightness &amp; Contrast.&quot;</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Better performance when running in a
					Remote Desktop session by way of disabling dialog box /
					toolform transparency.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Zoom works correctly now: when you zoom
					in or out, the image will be centered to the intuitively
					correct location.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Lower memory usage and better resource
					usage in general.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">&quot;Paste&quot; now works with the Text tool.</font></li>

					more intuitive in some scenarios.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Improved &quot;History&quot; toolform user
					interface.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">User interface upgraded to make full use
					of XP themes. In v1.0, many dropdown boxes and &quot;updowns&quot; had
					a Win2K/OfficeXP look to them.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Other miscellaneous user interface
					tweaks.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Many &quot;under the hood&quot; improvements,
					tweaks, bug fixes and refactorizations.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">New file format. Paint.NET v1.1 stores
					files with a &quot;.pdn&quot; extension which is not compatible with
					Paint.NET v1.0&#39;s &quot;.lbmp&quot; extension.</font></li>
					<li><font size="2">Extensibility! After you install the
					program, check out the &quot;RotoZoomerSource.zip&quot; for an example
					of how to write an Effect plugin. You will need Visual
					Studio 2003 .NET to write a new plugin. No other types of
					plugins are supported for v1.1. </font></li>
